## Path quality

Our latest project brings together Natural England, the University of Oxford, Oxfordshire County Council, the Ramblers, Blenheim Palace, and Editions Systeme D to explore opportunities for crowdsourcing measurements of path quality.

Our initial work has focused on a public survey and literature review to ask the question: "What makes a good path?" You can read the survey results and summary here:

- [Summary report](/downloads/what_makes_a_good_path.pdf) (PDF)
- [Full responses](/downloads/what_makes_a_good_path_responses.xlsx) (Excel .xlsx format)

We are now developing a smartphone app, for launch in spring 2022, that combines user surveys and phone sensor data to record quality metrics. These will be available to local authorities, as custodians of the UK's public path network, and to volunteer surveyors in OpenStreetMap.
