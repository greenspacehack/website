## Biodiversity

One of the key characteristics of greenspaces that could impact health is biodiversity, i.e. species richness and abundance. Capturing information on biodiversity, however, is complicated and highly resource intensive, and little research exist to date on how local governments could incorporate biodiversity into planning and design of green spaces to assess its potential health and environmental impacts.

Two projects have been undertaken under the GreenspaceHack group to explore the importance of biodiversity of natural spaces as well as how to capture biodiversity of these spaces using Internet of Things technologies:

- [Nature Sensing Project](/project/nature_sensing.html)
