## Greenspace & path quality

Not all green, blue and natural places are created equal.  Differing levels of quality of these spaces can yield very different results in terms of both human and environmental health benefits that these spaces can deliver. 

Two projects have been undertaken under the Greenspace Hack group to explore the quality of natural spaces:

- [Developing the e-NEST tool](/project/survey.html)
- [Exploring the quality of paths](/project/path.html)
