## Nature Connection

There is a drive to increase people's exposure to nature through outdoor exercise and contact with nature given the many health and wellbeing benefits this provides.

Several projects have been undertaken under the GreenspaceHack group to explore how to improve peopleâ€™s connection with nature in a responsible way, including through green prescribing, to improve their physical and mental health:

- Exploring how technology can be used to support nature-based education
- Wellbeing Walks at Blenheim: Designing and implementing Wellbeing Walks for disadvantaged individuals at Blenheim Palace in collaboration with Aspire
- Greenspace & Us: Exploring how to co-design solutions with young women to help them engage more with nature
  - Descriptive report
  - Conceptual analysis
- MyVision Green Walks: exploring barriers and facilitators to support people with visual impairment to engage more with nature
  - Survey exploring barriers and facilitators for people with visual impairment to engage more with nature
  - A pilot of Green Walks done in collaboration with MyVision Oxfordshire
- [Countryside Access, Recreation, and Environmental Stewardship](/project/care.html) (CARE)
